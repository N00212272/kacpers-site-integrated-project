                <p>Outraged neighbours of Tom Niland, the pensioner who was savagely attacked by a gang last month, have offered a substantial reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of his ruthless attackers. Mr Niland (73) is fighting for his life after a barbaric beating in his home by three balaclava-clad men on January 18. The much loved retired farmer suffered horrific, life-threatening head injuries during the assault, which happened at 7pm when he answered a knock on his door and the attackers. </p>
